# Solidity Hardhat Experiments

This repo is a collection of all my "Hardhat Experiments". Basically a central repo for all the projects used to learn Hardhat and solidity form the basics. Will keep updating the repo as I move forward in my learning journey. Each project will be its own git sub-module in this repo.

To clone with all the sub-modules run clone command with `--recurse-submodules` flag. Each sub-module is a separate git repo.
